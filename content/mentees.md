# How To Be An ðŸŒŸGREATðŸŒŸ Mentee?

There is ONE type of mentee that exists. Active one. At least we experienced it in that way. Let me know if there is exists another approach to be.

*Be sure about:*

1. Have a descriptive [GitHub profile readme](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme)[^1].
2. Have a descriptive LinkedIn[^2] profile
3. Join the [discord Server](https://discord.gg/nkbmBSW8CM)

[^1]: GitHub profile best practises `(TO-DO)`
[^2]: LinkedIn profile best practises `(TO-DO)`

*Then:*

1. First, what you want to learn, *decide*.
2. You should visit [active mentorships](https://findmentor.network/mentorships/) page. *You don't want to miss* a mentorships campaign round.
3. You should visit [mentors](https://findmentor.network/mentors/) page. There are tons of *GREAT* mentors in there.
4. If the mentor does not have a mentorship campaign, ask politely over Twitter or LinkedIn.
5. If you want to work 1-1 with the mentor, ask the mentor to add their contact & schedule info like a superpeer account on GitHub profile readme. (This approach is not best way to be a great mentee. Just know it, that is a option.)

If you're looking for someone on Twitter or LinkedIn to be a mentor for you. Ask them for join us!
