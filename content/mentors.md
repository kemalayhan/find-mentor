# How To Be A 🌟ROCKSTAR🌟 Mentor?

**Three** types of mentorships model exist around the world. At least we know three of them. If you want to contribute [this](https://github.com/cagataycali/find-mentor/blob/master/content/mentors.md). You got this. ⚡️


## 🌟🌟🌟 Active - Passive Mentorships

The **best way to be a mentor**, engage the mentees in the flow w/o push harder or hussle.

In active passive approach:

Passive side:

* **mentor** comes up with a *complete blank project* like [this](https://findmentor.network)
* **mentor** add the blank project under active mentorships.
* **mentor** describes the project with a clear idea in the README.md.

Active side:

* **mentees** are *searching & digging* the [projects below the active mentorships page](https://findmentor.network/mentorships/)

Next steps:
- The mentor shares the mentorship campaign via over social networks with (Twitter, LinkedIn)
    - Example: I've created mentorship campaign over https://findmentor.network/peer/cagatay-cali called find-mentor. The project aims to meet the mentors & mentees. Already have 300+ mentees & mentors exists. (*That's cool recursion also, just the idea has been hacked.*)
- The mentor [joins discord server](https://discord.gg/nkbmBSW8CM).
- If any quick contact needs happen. Discord is fixing the communication needs.


In this approach, the mentor is the passive side of the equation. Mentees will be actively contributing to the mentorship project, they will learn how to do/build/lead the code.

This mentorships model is actually WORKING on this project. That's the reason you can read these lines.


## 🌟🌟 Active - Active Mentorships

In this model, the mentor sharing the contact way in [GitHub profile readme](https://dev.to/thesabesan/beautify-your-github-profile-readme-10cf).

The mentor and mentees contacting over social networks (twitter & linkedin & the discord channel) schedule the meeting daily/monthly etc.

Pros:
- Mentor & mentee contact directly.
- Communication is two way.

Cons:
- The mentor have to be leave a spot time for mentees.
- This approach can not be scalable.

## 🌟 Passive - Passive Mentorships

In this model, the mentor & mentee awaiting the feedback over https://findmentor.network below peer page.

This model also the greatest way to give & get feedback.
[How can you give a great feedback](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=how+can+I+give+better+feedback)

Pros:
- Easy to communicate
- Get & give feedback w/o dedicated time-consuming
- Everyone can read your feedback over the network. This feedback is not only for them. Everyone will get the notice.
Cons:
- The mentees should be ask the mentors for give a feedback. The mentors can be busy. Don't be rush.
